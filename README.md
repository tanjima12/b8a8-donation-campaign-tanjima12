## Add at least 3 Project features.

## sweetAlert:

\*SweetAlert is a library that allows you to easily create attractive and customizable pop-up messages, alerts, prompts, and confirmations in your React.js project.You need to install the SweetAlert library, either the standard version. This library provides the functionality to create and display various types of pop-up messages.In the component where i want to use SweetAlert, i import it at the top of your file. This gives me access to the SweetAlert functions and components.

## props:

\*"props" is a way to pass data from one component (the parent) to another component (the child). It stands for "properties" and is used for making components dynamic and reusable. In the parent component, you can define and send data to the child component using props. This data could be anything i want to customize the child component with, like text, numbers, functions, or even more complex objects.n the child component, i receive these props as arguments to my component function. then i can use this data to render content or perform logic within the child component.i used these as my props in my project : card,donation.

## Object destructuring:

\*Object destructuring is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to extract values from objects and assign them to variables in a more concise and convenient way. Instead of accessing object properties using dot notation, you can use destructuring to "unpack" values from objects into separate variables. It simplifies working with objects and makes your code more readable.
